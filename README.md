# Toolbox

This repo is a public repository of a personal workflow. It is made to provide a scaffolding for developing concepts, prototypes, or standalone tools. It is up to the user to give it shape according to its own likings. But in the basis it is running Vue, with vue-router, typescript & ES-lint. It also include some modules that I tend to enjoy using often in my practice.
